# RSA Implementation in Python

In this project, I was tasked in my CS401 Cryptography course to develop a functional RSA encryption and decryption system in a programming language of my choice. This project aided me in familiarizing me with beginner cryptography and the math behind the encryption algorithm. I learned about mathematical concepts like secure prime generation, modular arithmetic, and utilizing the Euclidean algorithm in my programming to properly construct a working RSA Python program. The program's algorithm is flexible to datasets and inputs of increasing sizes, and taught me about efficiency within cryptography algorithms.
