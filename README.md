# RSA Implementation in Python

In this project, I was tasked in my CS401 Cryptography course to develop a functional RSA encryption and decryption system in a programming language of my choice. This project aided me in familiarizing me with beginner cryptography and the math behind the encryption algorithm. I learned about mathematical concepts like secure prime generation, modular arithmetic, and utilizing the Euclidean algorithm in my programming to properly construct a working RSA Python program. The program's algorithm is flexible to datasets and inputs of increasing sizes, and taught me about efficiency within cryptography algorithms.

### To run a demonstration:

"rsa.py" is preconfigured in it's main() to use "input1pq.txt" and "input1text.txt" and run RSA encryption and decryption operations, so all that needs to be done is running rsa.py ! Additionally in the repository is .txt files that got example primes and pairs that are suitable for RSA as well!
